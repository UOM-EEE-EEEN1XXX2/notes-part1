Introduction
============

These course notes are split into 4 parts.

- `Part 0 on course adminstration <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/>`_. 

- `Part 1 (this part) on underlying theory of how computers operate <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/notes-part1/>`_. 

- `Part 2 on general purpose computing, mainly with Python <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/notes-part2/>`_. 

- `Part 3 on higher performance computing, mainly with Rust <https://uom-eee-eeen1xxx2.github.io/notes-part3/>`_.

In this Part we're going to look at a number of different ways in which computers operate. It would probably be possible to do an entire course on any one of these topics! Our aim isn't to be the expert in all of them. Rather, the aim is to have enough familarity in order to be able to progress with our programming.

We won't get very far with our programming without needing to know a little about how computers work *under the hood* in order to know why our code looks the way it does. If we treat the computer as black box, it's very hard to get the most oyt of it. We don't need to know everything about what's inside the box, but knowing a little helps a lot.

Remember that computers are human designed objects - they work the way they do because someone decided to make them work that way. Sometimes these decisions make a lot of sense. Sometimes the decision made sense at the time, possibly 50+ year ago. We might do it differently if we were to do it today, but we have to stick with what's already in place. Sometimes, different people decided different things, and there are different standards or ways of doing things. We need to pick one to actually use, even if other choices are perfectly good and someone else might pick a different one. Before starting our programming we need to know a little about which choices we're making and why. This includes learning about some common software development techniques.

In places some of what we cover will be a bit *approximate*. The desciriptions are sufficient and accurate for the depth we need them to be for this course. If you go on to cover some of the topics in more detail, you might find that some of the definitions get refined and a bit tighter compared to what we have here.
